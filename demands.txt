# This file is intended to define the architecture of this project.

User: Students

Relationships:
 - Faculty → Degrees
 - Degree → Curriculum versions
 - Curriculum → Requirements for mandatory courses

Bucket → course list + mandatory subset + min selection + counting policy
Each faculty should hold:
- The existing degrees it offers (O(1))
- A "list" of courses it offers - with points
- A "List" of archived courses - with points.


Each degree should hold:
- The mandatory courses in that degree
- The "Free choice" courses (usually faculty will hold same free choices for the different degrees)
- The "core" curses (if exists)
- The specialties (shrsheraot) - How many the students needs to do
- How many Mandatory points im expected to do
- How many Total points I need to do (not including sports or MALAG)
- How many MALAG / Sports points need to do




Each bucket should hold:
- "List" of the available courses
- For specialty buckets - What courses are mandatory knowledge (A student must learn, even if not as part of this bucket)
- min courses / points that need to be choosed as part of this bucket

- Mandatory is a bucket where all courses must be done and counted as part of the bucket therefore without mandatory knowledge field
- Core is a bucket without mandatory knowledge

Student info (received as input from user)

- faculty
- degree
- Start semester (so we can assume the catalog version for the mandatory) , the smartest way to implement this semester change needs to be tested
- Chosen Specialties (Sharsherot) - if Chosen
- courses already done
        *support parsing of English transcript
        * Manual Adding of courses

- Exeptions:
        * At this point the student needs to see what are the exact requirements in his degree and allow him to add exeptions,
exception types:
    
    course_counts_as(course -> bucket/category)
    overrides/waivers (Reduce number of points needed to complete in specific buckets)
    exclude_course(course)
    force_include_course(course)

- Planned courses (in the sense that student will want to do them, will be marked as x=1 in optimization, but remember to return in the remaining courses list)
- Courses To avoid


Output:
- If satisfied all requirements, with courses already done, output document, with all the details. What courses were taken (and under which catagory), if there were exeptions and so on.
- If not satisfied, output courses left to do (best 2 options)

- After this stage, when the student gets the options, he can edit, ie, ask to avoid certain courses, and get an updated option.


Admin

- can edit the available courses.
- can archive courses




Optimization problem:

- Archived courses should not be offered in the "To do" , but should be counted as x=1 in case a student did it 
- A course can be counted only in one bucket
- When all requirements are met, except the min points, choose from the "free choice"
(optimization should acvheive this without extra effort)
- Define properly the constraints of mandatory knowledge (some times involves bot "or" and "and" conditions)


-   Variables only for currently offered + eligible courses
    Satisfaction can come from:
    passed courses (including historical ones)
    equivalencies/substitutions
    overrides/waivers
    selected new courses (decision variables)
